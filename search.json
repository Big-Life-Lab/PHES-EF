    "text": "Procedure\nWe will conduct a two-round e-Delphi survey to generate consensus on evaluation criteria (Figure 2). Summaries of Round 1 will be compiled for the subsequent round. Custom survey pathways will be generated for each stakeholder group (i.e., panellists from different stakeholder groups will be shown a different collection of candidate items). Within each custom stakeholder survey pathway, panellists will also have the option to skip items or self-declare that they are not qualified to assess certain candidate items.\n\nRound 1\nPanellists will be invited to rate their level of agreement with candidate items generated from scoping review results and consultation with the study executive group.\n\n\nRound 2\nPanellists will rate their level of agreement with newly identified candidate items from the first e-Delphi round and to re-rate their level of agreement for items that did not reach consensus during the previous round. Anonymous feedback from Round 1 panellists will also be compiled and presented during Round 2. Any newly suggested items during Round 2 will be deliberated on during the consensus meeting.\n\n\nDefining Consensus\nConsensus for each item is defined as ≥ 70% of the panelist votes falling within the same grouping of three categories within a 7-point Likert scale:\n\nCore Item: Highly or moderately relevant\nFurther Discussion: Slightly relevant, neutral, slightly irrelevant\nExcluded Item: Moderately or highly irrelevant\n\nThe survey will include a free-text box for panellist to provide comments or suggest new items.

Overview of the development process for the Public Health Environmental Surveillance Evaluation Framework (PHES-EF)\n\nStep 1: Establishment of the Executive Group\nA multinational and multidisciplinary executive group of 12 members will oversee the development of the evaluation framework. The group will bring expertise from the following fields: mathematical sciences, social sciences, environmental and physical sciences, public health and medicine, and public interest/knowledge users.\nThe executive group will be responsible for providing feedback on the framework development process, connecting the study to other related projects, recruiting electronic Delphi (e-Delphi) panellists, participating in the consensus meeting, disseminating the evaluation framework, advising and/or participating in post-publication activities, and promoting the adoption of the evaluation framework among their professional networks.\nYou can learn more about the study executive group members here.\n\n\nStep 2: Generation of Candidate Items\nWe will conduct relevant scoping review(s) and consult the study’s expert executive group to generate a list of PHES-EF e-Delphi candidate items.\nRelevant scoping review registrations and publications can be accessed here.\n\n\nStep 3: International e-Delphi Survey\nWe will use an e-Delphi technique to develop an internationally accepted evaluation framework for public health environmental surveillance. The Delphi method is an iterative multi-round approach that uses a series of sequential surveys, interspersed by controlled feedback, to elicit consensus among a group of individuals while maintaining anonymity (2). We will use the e-Delphi method to overcome geographic barriers and allow us to engage panellists internationally across various time zones.\nFor more details, see the e-Delphi page.\n\n\nStep 4: Consensus Meeting\nIn preparation for the consensus meeting, the study working group will categorize candidate items for consideration into a preliminary evaluation framework. This will include merging and/or modifying items based on feedback gathered from the e-Delphi rounds.\nAn in-person or hybrid consensus meeting will be held after the results of the e-Delphi have been compiled and analysed. The primary objective will be to achieve expert consensus on the final list of items for PHES-EF, through review and discussion of salient items. This process will be guided by the empirical evidence that was identified during the scoping review(s), and the opinions gathered during the e-Delphi process.\nSteps to produce the final list of items are as follows: (i) present the results of e-Delphi exercise (name, rationale, and score of each item); (ii) discuss the rationale and relevance for including the items in the framework; and (iii) vote on equivocal and non-consensual items. PHES-EF will be developed based on the final list of items that receive consensus during the executive group consensus meeting.\n\n\nStep 5: Dissemination of Evaluation Framework\nThe development of the evaluation framework will be reported in a statement document that will include the rationale and a brief description of the meeting and the panellists involved. The evaluation framework will be made available as a preprint, prior to publication in an open-access peer-reviewed journal. PHES-EF will be made available using an open license (CC-BY-SA-4.0 license)."

An electronic Delphi (e-Delphi) method will be used to overcome geographic barriers and allow us to engage panellists internationally across various time zones. Delphi surveys relating to health sciences have typically been conducted over a period of 2-3 rounds (4–6). Therefore, a two-round e-Delphi survey paired with a subsequent consensus meeting will be conducted to balance feasibility with rigour. Each round will be active for approximately 4-6 weeks to allow panellists sufficient time to participate in the survey, while balancing study timeline constraints (7)."

    "text": "This project will use a multidisciplinary and multinational consensus approach to develop an evaluation framework for public health environmental surveillance (Public Health Environmental Surveillance Evaluation Framework, PHES-EF) using wastewater surveillance as an example.\nA structured system or schema to systematically assess a program (1,2). An evaluation framework presents a clear list of items or elements such as constructs, concepts, that should appear in an evaluation; provides an organisation or structure for the list of items; defines how the list and organisation were developed; and, potentially, includes details about how to measure the evaluation items. Importantly, an evaluation framework facilitates informed decision-making by providing a comprehensive understanding of program effectiveness and areas for improvement."

    "section": "Approach",
    "text": "Approach\n\nOpen science\nThe project will follow an open-science approach and make available the data for all project stages, including the search strategy, search findings, initial curation of evaluation measures, summary of executive group discussions, e-Delphi processes, and agreement procedures.\nPHES-EF will be made available using an open license (CC-BY-SA-4.0 license). There will be a research data management plan to describe what data and information is available, and how to access tem. This will allow for the reuse of the data and the code, and will allow for the development of new tools and methods.\nFor more details, see the license section of this page.\n\n\nEquity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI)\n“Equity is defined as the removal of systemic barriers and biases enabling all individuals to have equal opportunity to access and benefit from the program” (3). To achieve this, members of the research team are committed to developing a strong understanding of the systemic barriers faced by individuals from underrepresented groups. “Diversity is defined as differences in race, colour, place of origin, religion, immigrant and newcomer status, ethnic origin, ability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and age”. Panellists will be asked to provide characteristic information (e.g., country of residence, gender, primary discipline) to assess and help ensure (through more targeted recruitment) a large diversity in perspectives. “Inclusion is defined as the practice of ensuring that all individuals are valued and respected for their contributions and are equally supported”. To help ensure that all research team members are integrated and supported, we will have a code of conduct statement in the Executive Group Terms of Reference.\nAll study working group members will complete EDI-related Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR) Training, and the First Nations principles of Ownership, Control, Access and Possession (OCAP©) training for the research (4). The executive group will receive an overview of EDI and OCAP and will be encouraged and supported to complete such training. Furthermore, staff trained in EDI and OCAP principles will review the framework from an EDI perspective to ensure appropriate language.\n\n\nKnowledge user and public involvement\nTo ensure accurate and transparent reporting of knowledge users and public involvement throughout the study, we will refer to the Guidance for Reporting Involvement of Patients and the Public (GRIPP2) checklist (5). We will document the methods used to engage knowledge users, report the impacts and outcomes of their engagement, and report on lessons learned from the experience."
