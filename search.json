    "text": "The Public Health Environmental Surveillance Evaluation Framework (PHES-EF) will be developed in five steps. In Step 1, a multinational and multidisciplinary executive group will be formed to guide the framework development process. In Step 2, candidate items for Round 1 of the e-Delphi will be generated by conducting relevant scoping reviews and consultation with the study executive group. In Step 3, an international e-Delphi will be conducted over two rounds to develop consensus on items for the framework. In Step 4, the executive group will reconvene to finalize the evaluation framework, discuss standout items, and determine the dissemination strategies. Lastly, Step 5 will focus on disseminating the evaluation framework to all potential stakeholders using traditional and public-oriented methods.\nFigure 1.

E-Delphi and consensus meeting methodology, methods to achieve consensus on core items for the Public Health Environmental Surveillance Evaluation Framework (PHES-EF).\n\nStep 4: Consensus Meeting\nIn preparation for the consensus meeting, the study working group will categorize the remaining candidate items for consideration into a preliminary evaluation framework. This will include merging and/or modifying the remaining items based on gathered feedback from the e-Delphi rounds.\nAn in-person or hybrid consensus meeting will be held after the results of the e-Delphi have been compiled and analysed. The primary objective will be to achieve expert consensus on the final list of items for PHES-EF, through review and discussion of salient items. This process will be guided by the empirical evidence that was identified during the scoping review(s), and the opinions gathered during the e-Delphi process. The secondary objective will be to discuss publication and dissemination strategies for the final evaluation framework.\nSteps to produce the final list of items are as follows: (i) present the results of e-Delphi exercise (name, rationale, and score of each item); (ii) discuss the rationale and relevance for including the items in the framework; and (iii) vote on equivocal and non-consensual items. PHES-EF will be developed based on the final list of items that receive consensus during the executive group consensus meeting.\n\n\nStep 5: Dissemination of Evaluation Framework\nThe dissemination of this evaluation framework will start with the publication of the PHES-EF protocol. Active dissemination approaches will include presenting at relevant scientific conferences, holding webinars, and conducting workshops. Additional dissemination practices will be determined during the consensus meeting.\nThe development of the evaluation framework will be reported in a statement document that will include the rationale and a brief description of the meeting and the panellists involved. The evaluation framework will be made available as a preprint, prior to publication in an open-access peer-reviewed journal. PHES-EF will be made available using an open license (CC-BY-SA-4.0 license)."

    "text": "What is a Delphi?\nThe Delphi method is an iterative multi-round approach that uses a series of sequential surveys, interspersed by controlled feedback, to elicit consensus among a group of individuals while maintaining anonymity (19,20). An electronic Delphi (e-Delphi) method will be used to overcome geographic barriers and allow us to engage panellists internationally across various time zones. Delphi surveys relating to health sciences have typically been conducted over a period of 2-3 rounds (17,21,22). Therefore, a two-round e-Delphi survey paired with a subsequent consensus meeting will be conducted to balance feasibility with rigour. Each round will be active for approximately 4-6 weeks to allow panellists sufficient time to participate in the survey, while balancing study timeline constraints (23)."

Individual responses to e-Delphi rounds will be anonymous at the source level by the platform used.\n\n\nEquity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI)\n“Equity is defined as the removal of systemic barriers and biases enabling all individuals to have equal opportunity to access and benefit from the program”(1). To achieve this, members of the research team are committed to developing a strong understanding of the systemic barriers faced by individuals from underrepresented groups. “Diversity is defined as differences in race, colour, place of origin, religion, immigrant and newcomer status, ethnic origin, ability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and age”. Panellists will be asked to provide characteristic information (e.g., country of residence, gender, primary discipline) to assess and help ensure (through more targeted recruitment) a large diversity in perspectives. “Inclusion is defined as the practice of ensuring that all individuals are valued and respected for their contributions and are equally supported”. To help ensure that all research team members are integrated and supported, we will have a code of conduct statement in the Executive Group Terms of Reference.\nAll study working group members will complete EDI-related Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR) Training, and the First Nations principles of Ownership, Control, Access and Possession (OCAP©) training for the research (2). The executive group will receive an overview of EDI and OCAP and will be encouraged and supported to complete such training. Furthermore, staff trained in EDI and OCAP principles will review the framework from an EDI perspective to ensure appropriate language.\n\n\nKnowledge User and Public Involvement\nTo ensure accurate and transparent reporting of knowledge users and public involvement throughout the study, we will refer to the Guidance for Reporting Involvement of Patients and the Public (GRIPP2) checklist (3). We will document the methods used to engage knowledge users, report the impacts and outcomes of their engagement, and report on lessons learned from the experience."
