    "text": "A Delphi technique will be used to develop an internationally accepted evaluation framework for public health environmental surveillance. The Delphi method is an iterative multi-round approach that uses a series of sequential surveys, interspersed by controlled feedback, to elicit consensus among a group of individuals while maintaining anonymity (1,2). An electronic Delphi (e-Delphi) method will be used to overcome geographic barriers and allow us to engage panellists internationally across various time zones.\nThe study protocol is currently in publication with PLOS One. However, the pre-print is available on MedRxiv.\n\n\nWe will recruit a multinational, multidisciplinary panel of wastewater-based surveillance experts, knowledge users, and engaged members of the public to complete the e-Delphi survey. Panellists will be selected to capture the multiple perspectives of those that influence the design, implementation, evaluation, use, and reporting of wastewater surveillance activities, including the following subdisciplines groups: public health, infectious disease, epidemiology; environmental and physical sciences; mathematical sciences; social sciences; and communication, knowledge translation and exchange.\nwe will aim to recruit at least 50 panellists. Preferably, with at least 8-10 people per discipline subgroup. The study working group will monitor the distribution of registered panellists based on their demographic information and will try to distribute appropriately across discipline subgroups and other demographic markers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscipline subgroup\nInclusion criteria\n\n\n\n\nPublic health, infectious disease, epidemiology Environmental and physical science Mathematical sciences Social sciences Communication, knowledge translation and Exchange\nAn adult1 who is proficient in English and has a graduate degree in one of the listed specializations2, or ≥ 3 years of professional experience, or ≥ 2 peer-reviewed publications relating to wastewater surveillance.\n\n\nKnowledge users\nAn adult1 who is proficient in English and who is a professional who does not have specialized training or qualifications in wastewater-based surveillance, but who uses surveillance to inform policy and action in their workplace.\n\n\nEngaged public\nAn adult1 who is proficient in English and has relevant lived experience.\n\n\n\n1 Adult: ≥ 18 years of age.\n\n\n2 The list of specializations associated with each discipline can be found in the S2 Table of the study protocol once published.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinitions\nProfessional experience: Paid employment or professional practice in a listed specialization (current or former). Graduate or professional degree: Master or PhD in a listed discipline/specialization.\n\n\n\n\nWe will conduct a two-round e-Delphi survey to generate consensus on evaluation criteria (Figure 2). Summaries of Round 1 will be compiled for the subsequent round. Custom survey pathways will be generated for each stakeholder group (i.e., panellists from different stakeholder groups will be shown a different collection of candidate items). Within each custom stakeholder survey pathway, panellists will also have the option to skip items or self-declare that they are not qualified to assess certain candidate items.\n\n\nPanellists will be invited to rate their level of agreement with candidate items generated from scoping review results and consultation with the study executive group. Free-text boxes will be included for panellists to provide feedback or identify additional candidate items to be included in the next e-Delphi survey round.\n\n\n\nRegardless of whether they participated in the previous round, panellists will be invited to participate in Round 2 of the e-Delphi survey. All panellists will be invited to rate new items and re-rate previous items that did not reach consensus. When re-rating their level of agreement, panellists will be presented with their previous round scores alongside the aggregate group results. Anonymous feedback from Round 1 will also be compiled and presented during Round 2. Any newly suggested items during Round 2 will be deliberated on during the consensus meeting.\n\n\n\nCandidate items will be assessed on the following four rating properties: (1) relevance and practical utility; (2) scientific rigor, validity and reliability; (3) feasibility, adaptability and resource implications; and (4) equity, inclusiveness, and mitigation of bias.\nA 7-point Likert scale (1 = highly irrelevant to 7 = highly relevant) will be used to rate each property for all candidate items. A summary score for each candidate item will be created by calculating the median of the four property ratings. Panellist summary scores will then be categorised as excluded item (irrelevant: 1–2), further discussion (equivocal: 3–5), or core item (relevant: 6–7). Consensus for each item is defined as ≥ 70% of the panellist votes falling within the same category (1–2, 3–5, or 6–7).\nThe approach to use a 7-point fully-labeled Likert scale – a higher number of categories compared to many studies – is informed by the consideration that panellists are professionals and engaged members of the public with good cognitive skills; therefore, more categories and labels will be more discriminating and reproducible (3–6). The ≥ 70% consensus cut-off – a lower cut-off compared to many studies – is informed by the rapidly evolving nature of environmental surveillance for public health and the wide range of disciplines invited to the panel; therefore, a high level of agreement may not occur (3–6).\n Figure 2.

    "text": "This project will adopt a multidisciplinary and multinational consensus approach to develop the Public Health Environmental Surveillance Evaluation Framework (PHES-EF), using wastewater-based surveillance as an example.\nEvaluation framework definition: An evaluation framework is a structured system designed to systematically assess the effectiveness and impact of a program (1,2). It typically outlines key components - such as domains, concepts, and indicators or measures - that should be included in an evaluation. It also provides a logical organization of these components, explains the process by which they were identified and prioritized, and may offer guidance on how to measure them. By offering a comprehensive and transparent basis for evaluation, such frameworks support informed decision-making and help identify areas for improvement in public health programs.\n\n\n\n\nThis project is committed to an open science approach, ensuring transparency and accessibility at every stage. All project data and materials will be made available, including the search strategy, search results, initial curation of evaluation measures, executive group discussion summaries, e-Delphi process documentation, and consensus procedures.\nPHES-EF will be made available under an open license (CC-BY-SA-4.0 license), enabling reuse, adaptation, and further development. A comprehensive research data management plan will outline the data and materials shared, along with guidance on how to access them - to support reproducibility and facilitate collaboration.\nFor licensing details, please refer to the license section of this page.\n\n\n\n“Equity is defined as the removal of systemic barriers and biases enabling all individuals to have equal opportunity to access and benefit from the program” (3). To achieve this, members of the research team are committed to developing a strong understanding of the systemic barriers faced by individuals from underrepresented groups.\n“Diversity is defined as differences in race, colour, place of origin, religion, immigrant and newcomer status, ethnic origin, ability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and age” (3). Panellists will be asked to provide characteristic information (e.g., country of residence, gender, primary discipline) to assess and help ensure (through more targeted recruitment) a large diversity in perspectives.\n“Inclusion is defined as the practice of ensuring that all individuals are valued and respected for their contributions and are equally supported” (3). To help ensure that all research team members are integrated and supported, we will have a code of conduct statement in the executive group Terms of Reference.\nAll study working group members will complete EDI-related Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR) Training, and the First Nations principles of Ownership, Control, Access and Possession (OCAP©) training for the research (4). The executive group will receive an overview of EDI and OCAP and will be encouraged and supported to complete such training. Furthermore, staff trained in EDI and OCAP principles will review the framework from an EDI perspective to ensure appropriate language.\n\n\n\nTo ensure accurate and transparent reporting of knowledge users and public involvement throughout the study, we will refer to the Guidance for Reporting Involvement of Patients and the Public (GRIPP2) checklist (5). We will document the methods used to engage knowledge users, report the impacts and outcomes of their engagement, and report on lessons learned from the experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis project is funded by the Canadian Institutes for Health Research-funded network, CoVaRR-Net (Coronavirus Variants Rapid Response Network. FRN: 175622), and Health Canada (through the Safe Restart Agreement Contribution Program. Arrangement #: 2223-HQ-000098). The Canadian Institutes for Health Research and Health Canada have not been involved in the design or conduct or the study and the views expressed herein do not necessarily represent the views of either funding organization.\n\n\n\nThis study has received ethical approval (20230428-01H) from the Ottawa Health Science Network Research Ethics Board (OHSN-REB). Implied consent will be obtained from all panellists prior to participating in the e-Delphi survey. Information about the survey and consent practices will be provided on the first page of the survey. Panellists will be informed that by providing their demographic information and proceeding to the next page, they are providing their implied consent to participate in the study. Only anonymous panellist responses will be used for analyses. All panellist data and responses will be password protected and only REB-approved study working group members from the Ottawa Hospital will have access to the data.\nIf you have questions about ethical issues related to this study, you can talk to someone who is not involved in the study at the Ottawa Health Science Network Research Ethics Board, Chairperson at +1-613-798-5555 ext. 16719.\n\n\n\nAll participants (i.e., study working group, executive group, and e-Delphi panellists) will be asked to declare any financial or personal relationships that may influence either the conduct or presentation of this research.\n\n\n\nThis website hosts a range of content, including references to journal articles, research papers, and other educational materials.\nThe majority of the content on this website is licensed under two Creative Commons licenses: CC-BY-4.0 (Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International) and CC-BY-SA-4.0 (Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International).\nPlease see the license page for more information.\n\n\n\nAnonymous aggregate data will be made available on our Open Science Framework (OSF) project page upon study completion.

    "text": "The Public Health Environmental Surveillance Evaluation Framework (PHES-EF) will be developed in five stages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Overview of the development process for the Public Health Environmental Surveillance Evaluation Framework (PHES-EF)\n\n\nA multinational and multidisciplinary executive group will oversee the development of the evaluation framework. The group will bring expertise from various fields, including public health, infectious disease, epidemiology, environmental and physical sciences, mathematical sciences, social sciences, communication, knowledge translation and exchange, knowledge users, and an engaged public.\nThe executive group will be responsible for providing feedback on the framework development process (e.g., framework organization, completeness, additions, redundancy), supporting and advising working groups in their area of expertise, connecting the study to other related projects, recruiting e-Delphi panellists, participating in the consensus meeting, disseminating the evaluation framework, advising and/or participating in post-publication activities, and promoting the adoption of the evaluation framework among their professional networks. Co-chairs will also be responsible for decision-making when the executive group cannot reach a consensus, leading executive group activities, and the overall framework development process.\nFor more information about the members of the study’s Executive Group, please visit the Team page.\n\n\n\nWe will systematically compile a list of e-Delphi candidate items through scoping reviews, content analysis and extraction, and executive group consultation.\nYou can view relevant scoping review registrations and publications on our Documents page.\n\n\n\nA Delphi technique will be used to develop an internationally accepted evaluation framework for public health environmental surveillance. The Delphi method is an iterative multi-round approach that uses a series of sequential surveys, interspersed by controlled feedback, to elicit consensus among a group of individuals while maintaining anonymity (1,2). An e-Delphi method will be used to overcome geographic barriers and allow us to engage panellists internationally across various time zones.\nFor more details, please refer to the e-Delphi Study page.\n\n\n\nIn preparation for the consensus meeting, the study working group will categorize the remaining candidate items for consideration into a preliminary evaluation framework. This will include merging and/or modifying the remaining items based on gathered feedback from the e-Delphi rounds.\nAn in-person or hybrid (in-person and online) consensus meeting may be held using the Surveylet Delphi survey platform after the results of the e-Delphi have been compiled and analysed. The primary objective of the meeting will be to achieve expert consensus on the final list of items for PHES-EF, through review and discussion of salient items. This process will be guided by the empirical evidence that was identified during the scoping reviews, and the opinions gathered during the e-Delphi process. The secondary objective will be to discuss publication and dissemination strategies for the final evaluation framework.\nSteps to produce the final list of items are as follows: (i) present the results of the e-Delphi exercise (name, rationale, and score of each item); (ii) discuss the rationale and relevance for including the items in the framework; and (iii) vote on equivocal and non-consensual items. PHES-EF will be developed based on the final list of items that receive consensus during the executive group consensus meeting.\n\n\n\nThe development of the evaluation framework will be reported in a statement document that will include the rationale and a brief description of the meeting, and the panellists involved. While the publication strategy will be finalized based on the consensus meeting discussion, the preliminary approach will be to post to OSF, as a preprint, before publication in an open-access peer-reviewed journal. During this time, we will actively seek feedback from experts, knowledge users, and the public within our networks and via social media. PHES-EF will be made available using an open license (CC-BY-SA-4.0 license).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Tricco ACT, Lillie E, Zarin W, O’Brien KK, Colquhoun H, Levac D, et al.

The group will bring expertise from various fields, including public health, infectious disease, epidemiology, environmental and physical sciences, mathematical sciences, social sciences, communication, knowledge translation and exchange, knowledge users, and an engaged public.\nThe executive group will be responsible for providing feedback on the framework development process (e.g., framework organization, completeness, additions, redundancy), supporting and advising working groups in their area of expertise, connecting the study to other related projects, recruiting e-Delphi panellists, participating in the consensus meeting, disseminating the evaluation framework, advising and/or participating in post-publication activities, and promoting the adoption of the evaluation framework among their professional networks. Co-chairs will also be responsible for decision-making when the executive group cannot reach a consensus, leading executive group activities, and the overall framework development process.\nFor more information about the members of the study’s Executive Group, please visit the Team page.\n\n\n\nWe will systematically compile a list of e-Delphi candidate items through scoping reviews, content analysis and extraction, and executive group consultation.\nYou can view relevant scoping review registrations and publications on our Documents page.\n\n\n\nA Delphi technique will be used to develop an internationally accepted evaluation framework for public health environmental surveillance. The Delphi method is an iterative multi-round approach that uses a series of sequential surveys, interspersed by controlled feedback, to elicit consensus among a group of individuals while maintaining anonymity (1,2). An e-Delphi method will be used to overcome geographic barriers and allow us to engage panellists internationally across various time zones.\nFor more details, please refer to the e-Delphi Study page.\n\n\n\nIn preparation for the consensus meeting, the study working group will categorize the remaining candidate items for consideration into a preliminary evaluation framework. This will include merging and/or modifying the remaining items based on gathered feedback from the e-Delphi rounds.\nAn in-person or hybrid (in-person and online) consensus meeting may be held using the Surveylet Delphi survey platform after the results of the e-Delphi have been compiled and analysed. The primary objective of the meeting will be to achieve expert consensus on the final list of items for PHES-EF, through review and discussion of salient items. This process will be guided by the empirical evidence that was identified during the scoping reviews, and the opinions gathered during the e-Delphi process. The secondary objective will be to discuss publication and dissemination strategies for the final evaluation framework.\nSteps to produce the final list of items are as follows: (i) present the results of the e-Delphi exercise (name, rationale, and score of each item); (ii) discuss the rationale and relevance for including the items in the framework; and (iii) vote on equivocal and non-consensual items. PHES-EF will be developed based on the final list of items that receive consensus during the executive group consensus meeting.\n\n\n\nThe development of the evaluation framework will be reported in a statement document that will include the rationale and a brief description of the meeting, and the panellists involved. While the publication strategy will be finalized based on the consensus meeting discussion, the preliminary approach will be to post to OSF, as a preprint, before publication in an open-access peer-reviewed journal. During this time, we will actively seek feedback from experts, knowledge users, and the public within our networks and via social media. PHES-EF will be made available using an open license (CC-BY-SA-4.0 license)."
