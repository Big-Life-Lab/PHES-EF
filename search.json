    "text": "Background\nPublic health requires robust surveillance systems that inform decisions and guide timely interventions. As surveillance has evolved, especially during the global coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, diverse methods have emerged, with wastewater-based surveillance (wastewater surveillance) receiving significant attention(1).\nA structured evaluation of public health surveillance systems can improve program accountability, transparency, trust, and performance; thereby quantifying their value to public health and informing future surveillance needs(2).\nThe study seeks to develop an evaluation framework using a multidisciplinary and multinational consensus approach that considers current evidence for evaluating public health surveillance systems and new knowledge gained throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal is to identify criteria that should be used to evaluate environmental surveillance systems and provide guidance on how the criteria should be assessed."
