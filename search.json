This issue exemplifies the need for PHES-EF as an evaluation framework for public health environmental surveillance systems is required to increase their reliability and credibility, to inform public health decision-making. In turn, this will also promote their value and sustainability as a valuable public health tool.\nThere is also a need for such an evaluation framework as the recent and abrupt adoption of wastewater-based monitoring has resulted in poor standardization of analytic techniques, with ideal methods for reporting wastewater testing data also remaining unclear (1). Ultimately, PHES-EF aim to address this issue as well, as the framework is intended to be adopted by researchers to determine surveillance system performance and create analogous results for comparison within the field."

Individual responses to e-Delphi rounds will be anonymous at the source level by the platform used.\n\n\nEquity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI)\n“Equity is defined as the removal of systemic barriers and biases enabling all individuals to have equal opportunity to access and benefit from the program”(1). To achieve this, members of the research team are committed to developing a strong understanding of the systemic barriers faced by individuals from underrepresented groups. “Diversity is defined as differences in race, colour, place of origin, religion, immigrant and newcomer status, ethnic origin, ability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and age”. Panellists will be asked to provide characteristic information (e.g., country of residence, gender, primary discipline) to assess and help ensure (through more targeted recruitment) a large diversity in perspectives. “Inclusion is defined as the practice of ensuring that all individuals are valued and respected for their contributions and are equally supported”. To help ensure that all research team members are integrated and supported, we will have a code of conduct statement in the Executive Group Terms of Reference.\nAll study working group members will complete EDI-related Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR) Training, and the First Nations principles of Ownership, Control, Access and Possession (OCAP©) training for the research (2). The executive group will receive an overview of EDI and OCAP and will be encouraged and supported to complete such training. Furthermore, staff trained in EDI and OCAP principles will review the framework from an EDI perspective to ensure appropriate language.\n\n\nKnowledge User and Public Involvement\nTo ensure accurate and transparent reporting of knowledge users and public involvement throughout the study, we will refer to the Guidance for Reporting Involvement of Patients and the Public (GRIPP2) checklist (3). We will document the methods used to engage knowledge users, report the impacts and outcomes of their engagement, and report on lessons learned from the experience."

    "text": "What is a Delphi?\nThe Delphi method is an iterative multi-round approach that uses a series of sequential surveys, interspersed by controlled feedback, to elicit consensus among a group of individuals while maintaining anonymity (19,20). An electronic Delphi (e-Delphi) method will be used to overcome geographic barriers and allow us to engage panellists internationally across various time zones. Delphi surveys relating to health sciences have typically been conducted over a period of 2-3 rounds (17,21,22). Therefore, a two-round e-Delphi survey paired with a subsequent consensus meeting will be conducted to balance feasibility with rigour. Each round will be active for approximately 4-6 weeks to allow panellists sufficient time to participate in the survey, while balancing study timeline constraints (23)."

    "text": "Procedure\nWe will conduct a two-round e-Delphi survey to generate consensus on evaluation criteria. The full survey will be pre-tested and validated prior to administration. Summaries of Round 1 will be compiled for the subsequent round. Custom survey pathways will be generated for each stakeholder group (i.e., panellists from different stakeholder groups will be shown a different collection of candidate items). Within each custom stakeholder survey pathway, panellists will also have the option to skip items or self-declare that they are not qualified to assess certain candidate items.\n\nRound 1\nPanellists will be invited to rate their level of agreement with candidate items generated from scoping review results and consultation with the study executive group. Free-text boxes will be included for panellists to provide feedback or identify additional candidate items to be included in the next e-Delphi survey round.\n\n\nRound 2\nRegardless of whether they participated in the previous round, panellists will be invited to participate in Round 2 of the e-Delphi survey. They will be invited to rate their level of agreement with newly identified candidate items from the first e-Delphi round and to re-rate their level of agreement for items that did not reach consensus during the previous round. When re-rating their level of agreement, panellists will be presented with their previous round scores alongside the aggregate group results. Anonymous feedback from Round 1 panellists will also be compiled and presented during Round 2. Any newly suggested items during Round 2 will be deliberated on during the consensus meeting.\n\n\nDefining Consensus\nWe will use a 9-point Likert scale (1 = extremely irrelevant to 9 = extremely relevant). Panellist responses will be categorised as irrelevant (1–3), equivocal (4–6), or relevant (7–9). For each item, consensus will be reached if ≥ 80% of the panellist votes fall within the same category (1–3, 4–6, or 7–9) (26). The survey will include a free-text box for panellist to provide comments or suggest new items. Newly suggested items, as well as non-consensus items, will be listed in the second round.\n\n\nStopping Rules\nWhen ≥ 80% of the panellist votes fall within the same category (1–3, 4–6, or 7–9) for a given item, no subsequent rounds of ranking for that item will be performed. Consensus items that are considered equivocal will be further deliberated during the consensus meeting."

In Step 1, a multinational and multidisciplinary executive group will be formed to guide the framework development process. In Step 2, candidate items for Round 1 of the e-Delphi will be generated by conducting relevant scoping reviews and consultation with the study executive group. In Step 3, an international e-Delphi will be conducted over two rounds to develop consensus on items for the framework. In Step 4, the executive group will reconvene to finalize the evaluation framework, discuss standout items, and determine the dissemination strategies. Lastly, Step 5 will focus on disseminating the evaluation framework to all potential stakeholders using traditional and public-oriented methods.\nFigure 1.

E-Delphi and consensus meeting methodology, methods to achieve consensus on core items for the Public Health Environmental Surveillance Evaluation Framework (PHES-EF).\n\nStep 4: Consensus Meeting\nIn preparation for the consensus meeting, the study working group will categorize the remaining candidate items for consideration into a preliminary evaluation framework. This will include merging and/or modifying the remaining items based on gathered feedback from the e-Delphi rounds.\nAn in-person or hybrid consensus meeting will be held after the results of the e-Delphi have been compiled and analysed. The primary objective will be to achieve expert consensus on the final list of items for PHES-EF, through review and discussion of salient items. This process will be guided by the empirical evidence that was identified during the scoping review(s), and the opinions gathered during the e-Delphi process. The secondary objective will be to discuss publication and dissemination strategies for the final evaluation framework.\nSteps to produce the final list of items are as follows: (i) present the results of e-Delphi exercise (name, rationale, and score of each item); (ii) discuss the rationale and relevance for including the items in the framework; and (iii) vote on equivocal and non-consensual items. PHES-EF will be developed based on the final list of items that receive consensus during the executive group consensus meeting.\n\n\nStep 5: Dissemination of Evaluation Framework\nThe dissemination of this evaluation framework will start with the publication of the PHES-EF protocol. Active dissemination approaches will include presenting at relevant scientific conferences, holding webinars, and conducting workshops. Additional dissemination practices will be determined during the consensus meeting.\nThe development of the evaluation framework will be reported in a statement document that will include the rationale and a brief description of the meeting and the panellists involved. The evaluation framework will be made available as a preprint, prior to publication in an open-access peer-reviewed journal. PHES-EF will be made available using an open license (CC-BY-SA-4.0 license)."
