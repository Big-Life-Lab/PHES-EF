title: "e-Delphi Study"

A Delphi technique will be used to develop an internationally accepted evaluation framework for public health environmental surveillance. The Delphi method is an iterative multi-round approach that uses a series of sequential surveys, interspersed by controlled feedback, to elicit consensus among a group of individuals while maintaining anonymity \[25,26\]. An electronic Delphi (e-Delphi) method will be used to overcome geographic barriers and allow us to engage panellists internationally across various time zones.

The full Delphi study protocol is prespecified and available [here](link). The protocol has been submitted for peer-review.

## Recruitment of Panelists

We will recruit a multinational, multidisciplinary panel of wastewater-based surveillance (wastewater surveillance) experts, knowledge users, and engaged public to complete the e-Delphi survey. Panellists will be selected to capture the multiple perspectives of the design, implementation, evaluation, reporting, and use, of wastewater surveillance.

We will conduct an all-rounds e-Delphi invitation approach, meaning that panellists will be invited to every round independent of whether they participated in the previous round [@shang2023; @niederberger2020]. We will aim to recruit at least 50 panellists, preferably, with at least 8-10 people per discipline group. The study working group will monitor the distribution of registered panellists based on their demographic information and will try to have appropriate distribution across disciplines and other demographic markers.

## Procedure

We will conduct a two-round e-Delphi survey to generate consensus on evaluation criteria. The full survey will be pre-tested and validated prior to administration. Summaries of Round 1 will be compiled for the subsequent round. Custom survey pathways will be generated for each stakeholder group (i.e., panellists from different stakeholder groups will be shown a different collection of candidate items). Within each custom stakeholder survey pathway, panellists will also have the option to skip items or self-declare that they are not qualified to assess certain candidate items.

### Round 1

Panellists will be invited to rate their level of agreement with candidate items generated from scoping review results and consultation with the study executive group. Free-text boxes will be included for panellists to provide feedback or identify additional candidate items to be included in the next e-Delphi survey round.

### Round 2

Regardless of whether they participated in the previous round, panellists will be invited to participate in Round 2 of the e-Delphi survey. They will be invited to rate their level of agreement with newly identified candidate items from the first e-Delphi round and to re-rate their level of agreement for items that did not reach consensus during the previous round. When re-rating their level of agreement, panellists will be presented with their previous round scores alongside the aggregate group results. Anonymous feedback from Round 1 panellists will also be compiled and presented during Round 2. Any newly suggested items during Round 2 will be deliberated on during the consensus meeting.

### Defining Consensus

We will use a 9-point Likert scale (1 = extremely irrelevant to 9 = extremely relevant). Panellist responses will be categorised as irrelevant (1--3), equivocal (4--6), or relevant (7--9). For each item, consensus will be reached if ≥ 80% of the panellist votes fall within the same category (1--3, 4--6, or 7--9) (26). The survey will include a free-text box for panellist to provide comments or suggest new items. Newly suggested items, as well as non-consensus items, will be listed in the second round.

### Stopping Rules

When ≥ 80% of the panellist votes fall within the same category (1--3, 4--6, or 7--9) for a given item, no subsequent rounds of ranking for that item will be performed. Consensus items that are considered equivocal will be further deliberated during the consensus meeting.
