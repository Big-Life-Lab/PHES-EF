# Public Health Environmental Surveillance Evaluation Framework (PHES-EF)

<br> *An international consensus study to develop an evaluation framework for public health environmental surveillance* <br>
:::

## Background

Public health requires robust surveillance systems to inform decisions and guide timely interventions. As surveillance has evolved, especially during the global coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, diverse methods have emerged, with wastewater-based surveillance (wastewater surveillance) receiving attention with widespread adoption.[@manuel2022]

A structured evaluation of public health surveillance systems can improve program accountability, transparency, trust, and performance; thereby quantifying their value to public health and informing future surveillance needs.[@cdc2001]

## Study objectives

The study's primary objective is to develop an evaluation framework for public health environmental surveillance (*PHES-EF*), using a multi-nation, mulitdisicplinary consensus approach. PHES-EF will identify criteria that should be used to evaluate environmental surveillance systems and provide guidance on how the criteria should be assessed.
