# Public Health Environmental Surveillance Evaluation Framework (PHES-EF)

<br> *An international consensus study to develop an evaluation framework for public health environmental surveillance* <br>
:::

## Background

Public health requires robust surveillance systems that inform decisions and guide timely interventions. As surveillance has evolved, especially during the global coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, diverse methods have emerged, with wastewater-based surveillance (wastewater surveillance) receiving significant attention[@manuel2022].

A structured evaluation of public health surveillance systems can improve program accountability, transparency, trust, and performance; thereby quantifying their value to public health and informing future surveillance needs[@cdc2001].

The study seeks to develop an evaluation framework using a multidisciplinary and multinational consensus approach that considers current evidence for evaluating public health surveillance systems and new knowledge gained throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal is to identify criteria that should be used to evaluate environmental surveillance systems and provide guidance on how the criteria should be assessed.

## Recruiting consensus panel members

-   consensus is critical

-   Open science.

## Objectives

Our primary objective is to develop an evaluation framework for public health environmental surveillance (*PHES-EF*), using a multi-nation, mulitdisicplinary consensus approach.

An evaluation framework provides structured guidance to facilitate a systematic approach to evaluation of the program.^10^ An evaluation framework includes: a clear list of items that should appear in an evaluation; an organisation or structure for the list of items; a description how the list and organisation were developed; and, potentially, details about how to measure the evaluation items.
