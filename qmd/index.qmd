# Public Health Environmental Surveillance Evaluation Framework (PHES-EF)

<br> *An international consensus study to develop an evaluation framework for public health environmental surveillance* <br>
:::

## Background

Public health requires robust surveillance systems that inform decisions and guide timely interventions. As surveillance has evolved, especially during the global coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, diverse methods have emerged, with wastewater-based surveillance (wastewater surveillance) receiving significant attention

[@manuel2022].

A structured evaluation of public health surveillance systems can improve program accountability, transparency, trust, and performance; thereby quantifying their value to public health and informing future surveillance needs [@cdc2001].

The study seeks to develop an evaluation framework using a multidisciplinary and multinational consensus approach that considers current evidence for evaluating public health surveillance systems and new knowledge gained throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal is to identify criteria that should be used to evaluate environmental surveillance systems and provide guidance on how the criteria should be assessed.

## Objectives

Our primary objective is to develop an evaluation framework for public health environmental surveillance (*PHES-EF*), using a multi-nation, mulitdisicplinary consensus approach.

An evaluation framework provides structured guidance to facilitate a systematic approach to evaluation of the program.^10^ While there is variation in the terminology used to describe frameworks, ^11^ we further define our approach as: presenting a clear list of items that should appear in an evaluation; providing an organisation or structure for the list of items; defining how the list and organisation were developed; and, potentially, including details about how to measure the evaluation items.

Our specific objectives are to:

1.  Engage a multidisciplinary executive group of international experts to inform the development of the evaluation framework.

2.  Review the literature to identify current guidance on surveillance evaluation items.

3.  Prioritize items for an evaluation framework for environmental surveillance using an international e-Delphi process.

4.  Conduct a consensus meeting that engages international representatives from all wastewater surveillance stakeholder groups to create an evaluation framework for public health environmental surveillance based on the multinational and multidisciplinary consensus.

5.  Develop a comprehensive dissemination plan for the evaluation framework.
