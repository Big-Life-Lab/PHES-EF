### Step 1: Establishment of the Executive Group

A multinational and multidisciplinary executive group of 12 members will oversee the development of the evaluation framework. The group will bring expertise from the following fields: mathematical sciences, social sciences, environmental and physical sciences, public health and medicine, and public interest/knowledge users.

The executive group will be responsible for providing feedback on the framework development process, connecting the study to other related projects, recruiting e-Delphi panellists, participating in the consensus meeting, disseminating the evaluation framework, advising and/or participating in post-publication activities, and promoting the adoption of the evaluation framework among their professional networks.

### Step 2: Generation of Candidate Items

We will conduct relevant scoping review(s) and consult the study's expert executive group to generate a list of PHES-EF e-Delphi candidate items.

Relevant scoping review registrations and publications can be accessed [here.](documents.qmd)

### Step 3: International e-Delphi Survey

We will use an electronic Delphi (e-Delphi) technique to develop an internationally accepted evaluation framework for public health environmental surveillance. The Delphi method is an iterative multi-round approach that uses a series of sequential surveys, interspersed by controlled feedback, to elicit consensus among a group of individuals while maintaining anonymity (19,20). We will use the e-Delphi method to overcome geographic barriers and allow us to engage panellists internationally across various time zones.

### Step 4: Consensus Meeting

In preparation for the consensus meeting, the study working group will categorize the remaining candidate items for consideration into a preliminary evaluation framework. This will include merging and/or modifying the remaining items based on gathered feedback from the e-Delphi rounds.

An in-person or hybrid consensus meeting will be held after the results of the e-Delphi have been compiled and analysed. The primary objective will be to achieve expert consensus on the final list of items for PHES-EF, through review and discussion of salient items. This process will be guided by the empirical evidence that was identified during the scoping review(s), and the opinions gathered during the e-Delphi process. The secondary objective will be to discuss publication and dissemination strategies for the final evaluation framework.

Steps to produce the final list of items are as follows: (i) present the results of e-Delphi exercise (name, rationale, and score of each item); (ii) discuss the rationale and relevance for including the items in the framework; and (iii) vote on equivocal and non-consensual items. PHES-EF will be developed based on the final list of items that receive consensus during the executive group consensus meeting.

### Step 5: Dissemination of Evaluation Framework

The dissemination of this evaluation framework will start with the publication of the PHES-EF protocol. Active dissemination approaches will include presenting at relevant scientific conferences, holding webinars, and conducting workshops. Additional dissemination practices will be determined during the consensus meeting.

The development of the evaluation framework will be reported in a statement document that will include the rationale and a brief description of the meeting and the panellists involved. The evaluation framework will be made available as a preprint, prior to publication in an open-access peer-reviewed journal. PHES-EF will be made available using an open license (CC-BY-SA-4.0 license).
