This project will be shaped by input from the multidisciplinary executive group, research conducted by the study working group, as well as by the feedback received from the Delphi process.

## Study steps
The Public Health Environmental Surveillance Evaluation Framework (PHES-EF) will be developed in five steps. In Step 1, a multinational and multidisciplinary executive group will be formed to guide the framework development process. In Step 2, candidate items for Round 1 of the e-Delphi will be generated by conducting relevant scoping reviews and consultation with the study executive group. In Step 3, an international e-Delphi will be conducted over two rounds to develop consensus on items for the framework. In Step 4, the executive group will reconvene to finalize the evaluation framework, discuss standout items, and determine the dissemination strategies. Lastly, Step 5 will focus on disseminating the evaluation framework to all potential stakeholders using traditional and public-oriented methods.
